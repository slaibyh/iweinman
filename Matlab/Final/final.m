%For my final I would track my location everyday that we have class. I
%would then put all the paths on one map of campus. I think it would be really
%cool to see all of the paths on top of eachother from around 10-16 days of
%walking. I could count the amount of time I went to certain parts of campus and make
%bar graphs of those. Since I have calc and physics before class on Thursdays, 
%but not on Tuesdays, I should have half as many points at my calc and physics 
%locations than our class' location.  At first I paused the tracking when I went 
%inside, but lately I have left it running the whole day. I can make graphs of 
%the total time of the "workout" and the calories I burned because it tracks those two. 

%Now that we are switching to online classes I'm not sure how much walking
%around campus I will be doing, so I'm not sure if this idea will work so
%well anymore.

%Another idea I had is to enhance satellites.m. Instead of just displaying the
%results in the command window, I think it would be cool to create a figure that
%shows the earth and the satellite. I could make a line from the center of earth 
%to the height of the satellite and have the length of that line. I could also
%make an arrow coming out of the satellite that shows its velocity 

A = imread('space.jpg');
B = imshow(A);

%In my head I'm picturing something like 'B', except the satellite would be
%going around the earth in a circle instead of going in front of it. For an
%extra challenge I could try animating it so that the satellite actually
%moves around the earth at the calculated velocity (to scale, obviously).
