`satellite.m` looks good, has comments, and produces the right results (50% of the time that is). I would take another look at what happens in line 13 - there is something that happens in line 11 that makes line 13 and the resulting calculation problematic, do you see it? Also, I do expect some comments about the questions in the problem statement to show up in the comments of the script.

Especially in Problem 4, you display nothing because all statements are ended in `;`
