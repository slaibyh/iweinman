`satellite.m` looks good, has comments, and produces the right results (50% of the time that is). I would take another look at what happens in line 13 - there is something that happens in line 11 that makes line 13 and the resulting calculation problematic, do you see it? Also, I do expect some comments about the questions in the problem statement to show up in the comments of the script.
